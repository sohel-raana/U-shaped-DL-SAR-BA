# SAR-Based Burned Area Mapping with U-Shaped Deep Learning Models

This repository provides code and resources for burned area mapping using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and U-shaped deep learning architectures. The project focuses on leveraging Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter for robust burned area detection under challenging conditions such as cloud cover, where optical imagery is unavailable.

## üîç Overview

Wildfires are a major disturbance to ecosystems, and timely detection of burned areas is essential for disaster response and environmental monitoring. Optical data (e.g., Sentinel-2) are widely used, but cloud cover and smoke often delay availability. SAR data provide an all-weather, day-and-night alternative.

In this repository, we implement and evaluate U-shaped deep learning models (e.g., U-Net, Attention U-Net, Nested U-Net) for burned area mapping from SAR imagery. The pipeline includes preprocessing, patch generation, training, evaluation, and visualization.
